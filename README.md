## Overview

This is a real-time facial authentication system that is designed to verify a personâ€™s identity using just their webcam, with a strong focus on preventing spoofing and fake login attempts. The system ensures that only real, live users can access protected areas by combining face recognition with smart security checks.

## Features

- **Secure User Enrollment**: Lets users enroll their facial data to the database.

- **3-Stage anti-spoofing verification**:
  - **Fourier Analysis**: Detects screen replay attacks by analyzing frequency patterns.
  - **3D Shape Analysis**: Uses MediaPipe's landmark depth data (Z-coordinate) to defend against flat photo attacks.
  - **Liveness Detection**: Confirms the subject is alive by monitoring for natural blinks and subtle head movements.
